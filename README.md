A python script to find an ISS sighting for tomorrow through NASA's spot the station API. <br />
Function should work for any mononym city and state names available from the API. <br />

Checks 3 hour forecast data from open weather API for the time of the longest sighting found. <br />
Only tweets when the sky is forecasted to be clear to be sure the ISS will be visible. <br />

# Future Improvements to code <br />
- account for states and cities with multi-word names <br />
