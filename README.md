A python script to find an ISS sighting for tomorrow through NASA's spot the station API <br />
function should work for any mononym city and state names available from the API <br />
checks 3 hour forecast data from open weather API for the time of the longest sighting found <br />
only tweets when the sky is forecasted to be clear to be sure the ISS will be visible <br />

# Future Improvements to code
- More efficient code for day of week assignment <br />
- account for states and cities with multi-word names <br />
