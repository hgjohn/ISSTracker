# ISSTracker
Source code for https://twitter.com/lookuppnw

A python script to find an ISS sighting for tomorrow through NASA's spot the station API
function should work for any mononym city and state names available from the API
checks 3 hour forecast data from open weather API for the time of the longest sighting found
only tweets when the sky is forecasted to be clear to be sure the ISS will be visible

# Future Improvements to code
- More efficient code for day of week assignment
- account for states and cities with multi-word names
